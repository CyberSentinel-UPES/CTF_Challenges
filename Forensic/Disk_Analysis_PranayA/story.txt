We recovered the contents from the comupter of this particular individual codename 'Jeff', 
who is supposedly harboring a flag.
He erased a lot of his computer before we recovered a image, so there's just a couple files remaning.
Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to retrieve the flag - easy for an operative like you.
